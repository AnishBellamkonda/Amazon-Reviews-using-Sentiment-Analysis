# Amazon-Reviews-using-Sentiment-Analysis


****Business Problem****

Which product categories has lower reviews / maybe inferior products? (ie. electronics, iPad)
Which product have higher reviews / maybe superior products?
Business solutions:

Which products should be kept, dropped from Amazon's product roster (which ones are junk?)
Also: can we associate positive and negative words/sentiments for each product in Amazon's Catalog
By using Sentiment analysis, can we predict scores for reviews based on certain words
This dataset is based on Amazon branded/Amazon manufactured products only, and Customer satisfaction with Amazon products seem to be the main focus here.

Potential suggestion for product reviews:
Product X is highly rated on the market, it seems most people like its lightweight sleek design and fast speeds. Most products that were associated with negative reviews seemed to indicate that they were too heavy and they couldn't fit them in the bags. We suggest that next gen models for e-readers are lightweight and portable, based on this data we've looked at.

Assumptions:

We're assuming that sample size of 30K examples are sufficient to represent the entire population of sales/reviews
We're assuming that the information we find in the text reviews of each product will be rich enough to train a sentiment analysis classifier with accuracy (hopefully) > 70%
